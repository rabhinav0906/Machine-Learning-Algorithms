Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm. It's used for classification and regression tasks. 
In classification (SVM Classifier), it finds a hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes, maximizing the margin between them, making it effective for binary and multiclass classification problems.

In this Python code snippet, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is applied to a Social Network Ads dataset for binary classification. 
The dataset is loaded, split into training and testing sets, and then subjected to feature scaling using StandardScaler to ensure uniformity.
The SVM model with a linear kernel is trained on the scaled training set. Subsequently, predictions are made on the test set, and the results are evaluated using a confusion matrix and accuracy score. 
The confusion matrix provides a breakdown of correct and incorrect predictions, while the accuracy score quantifies the classifier's overall performance. 
This script is an implementation of a supervised learning pipeline, demonstrating the application of SVM for binary classification tasks and assessing the model's accuracy in predicting whether individuals in the dataset will purchase a product based on their social network features.
